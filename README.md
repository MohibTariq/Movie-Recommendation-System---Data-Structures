# Movie-Recommendation-System---Data-Structures
A Movie Recommendation System using Data Structures implemented in C++. This Project was completed by my group for the course "Data Structures".
Data is taken from a csv file named as Cleaned.csv. This data is then filtered out to carry out various operations on different movies.
